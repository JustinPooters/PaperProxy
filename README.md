# PaperProxy

Just a project to automate https://12ft.io/ because I'm a cheapskate (The plugin 12ft itself offers is'nt free and I'm Dutch), but mostly because I can. This project was initiated by a question to ChatGPT and I refactored and updated it a bit to be modern and new. It still isn't fancy, yet it does the job and replaces the listed urls in background.js with the paywall free version. See background.js:
